# calibration
This repository contains the scripts required to generate calibration files for MANGO imagers.

This includes a program for generating the starcal files (lists of stars and their relative positions in an image) as well as a program that performs fitting from these files to find the rotation angle and lens funtion that will be applied in raw image processing.
